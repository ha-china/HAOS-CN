## ⚠️ Important Notice

### 📦 Firmware Usage Guidelines
- 🚫 **Do NOT use test versions of firmware in production environments. All test firmware filenames contain `dev`.**

- 🎯 **Purpose of This Project:**  
  Designed to allow Chinese users to seamlessly enjoy the native Home Assistant OS experience without worrying about network accessibility issues.

---

### 🛡️ Server Protection Measures

Due to a recent surge of excessive invalid server requests (up to tens of thousands daily), to protect server resources and reduce operational costs, we've implemented the following strategies:

- 🔒 **Open Source Commitment**: Project source code remains fully open, adhering strictly to the open source spirit.
- 🛡️ **Build Information Protection**: Server-related information is concealed during the build process to prevent malicious or unintentional reference.

### ❤️ Server Sponsor

> **Infrastructure for this project is generously sponsored by [Shenzhen Coolkit Technology Co., Ltd.](https://www.coolkit.cn/).**

Thank you again for your understanding and support! 🙏

## 🖥️ Device Adaptation Contributions Welcome

🎉 Thank you for your willingness to contribute device adaptations to HAOS! To ensure user safety and system stability, all submitted code will be carefully reviewed. Thank you for your cooperation.

⚠️ As the official team is gradually phasing out devices with arm32 architecture, only x86_64 and aarch64 device adaptations are generally accepted (device manufacturers may discuss exceptions).

## 📝 PR Submission Guidelines

To keep the project structure organized and ensure smooth multi-device compilations, please adhere to these guidelines:

### 📂 Directory Structure Requirements
- 🗂️ **Device configuration directories**  
  Place them under `buildroot-external\board\`  
  - 📍 Direct placement, e.g.: `board\orangepi_CM4`  
  - 🏷️ Brand subdirectory, e.g.: `board\orangepi\computer_model4`

- ⚙️ **Build configuration files**  
  Place all defconfig files in `buildroot-external\config`  
  Example: `orangepi_cm4_deconfig`

- 📦 **Additional packages**  
  Any extra packages should be added to the `packages` directory, one folder per package

- ❓ **For files outside these directories**  
  Please provide clear reasons in your submission

## ⚡ Important Reminders
1. 🚫 Do NOT edit HAOS official source files or other directories
2. 🚫 Do NOT create directories outside those specified above
3. 🔍 If there are questions regarding your code or your PR lacks sufficient description, you may be contacted for clarification
4. ❌ Code submissions that cannot be reasonably explained will not be merged

🤝 We look forward to building a better HAOS ecosystem in China together!

🐛 If there are bugs or questions about the firmware you submit, please help respond in the issues area. Thank you very much!
